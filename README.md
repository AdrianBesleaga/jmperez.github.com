# JMPerez Blog

This is the source code for my Jekyll powered blog [jmperezperez.com](https://jmperezperez.com).

Some features:

- It is hosted as GitHub pages and served with a custom domain.
- It supports [redirects](https://github.com/JMPerez/jmperez.github.com/blob/master/_layouts/redirection.html) to make all links still work.
- It uses [tags](https://github.com/JMPerez/jmperez.github.com/blob/master/tags/index.html) as a way to categorise posts.
- It uses [Grunt](https://github.com/JMPerez/jmperez.github.com/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L10-L11) to combine and minify CSS files.
- It has [a good performance](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjmperezperez.com%2F).
