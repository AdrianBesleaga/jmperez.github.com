I have just come across the post [Improve the payment experience with animations - Behind the scenes of Stripe Checkout
](https://medium.com/p/3d1b0a9b810e). I must say that I don't usually take into account animations when building a UI, since the priority is always the layout and I seldom have time to enhance the interface with subtle animations.

After reading the article one starts appreciating those transitions that became a thing when the iPhone went out (maybe [too much on iOS7?](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/27/ios-7-motion-sickness-nausea). The good thing is that good animations make the interface look smoother and more professional, and it just feels great to use it. However, it is very easy to end up overusing animations and applying them to lots of elements just because it is possible.

On the web, it is sometimes difficult to create proper animations without lots of hacks like duplicating elements and setting fixed dimensions and absolute positioning. And this, together with responsive design, makes it a real challenge.

There are many websites for getting inspired and seeing how animations are used in practice. Many of those sites are listed on  [Interface Animations and Transitions: where to get inspiration](http://www.inpixelitrust.fr/blog/en/interface-animations-and-transitions-where-to-get-inspiration/).
