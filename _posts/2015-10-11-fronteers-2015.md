description: Fronteers 2015 - Some notes about the conference in Amsterdam.
---

This was my first time in Fronteers, surrounded by lots of frontend developers and designers in an amazing venue in Amsterdam. Here I have a quick review of its talks.

The conference covered frontend development from several views. There were talks about interesting browser APIs, accessibility, developer tools, build tools, progressive enhancement, design guidelines, open data, how to structure teams or how to deal with projects and clients. It was very well organised, with good food, coffee and other snacks, as well as after-talk mingling.

Until the videos are published, you can find [the slides from Fronteers 2015 on Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2015/fronteersconf/), which I have collected from the speakers presentations and tweets.

## Things I learned

- I love [Filament Group](https://www.filamentgroup.com/). I started following [their blog](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/) after coming across some of their posts focused on progressive enhancement and responsive design. They are great sharing real use cases and open sourcing their solutions. [Scott Jehl](http://scottjehl.com/) did a great talk about performance optimisation for all kind of assets (images, fonts, CSS, JS) and the future (almost present) HTTP 2.

- UK is full of great agencies and people who care about the web. The guys from [Primate](http://primate.co.uk/) talked about how they started with their company and how they have dealt with projects and clients. It's always great seeing talks about real experiences. [Anna Debenham](http://maban.co.uk/) talked about design guidelines and [Alice Bartlett](http://alicebartlett.co.uk/) about accessibility and her past work in Government Digital Service (part of gov.uk).

  There is something especial in the UK, in how private and public companies are building websites in the right way and how well they share their findings. Take for instance [BBC and their Responsive News](http://responsivenews.co.uk/), [Gov.uk and their amazing guides on design, development and testing amongst others](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) and [The Guardian's take on responsive web](http://next.theguardian.com/). I can't but regret not seeing similar efforts from other web sites.

- Good speakers are even better in person. I have seen numerous recorded talks by Christian Heilmann and Jake Archibald, and seeing them right there is even better. They definitely excel at speaking and delivering their message, are really fun and true to their principles.
