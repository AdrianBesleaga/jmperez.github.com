# Hello, I am **José Manuel Pérez**.

I am a Software Engineer and who likes web development and performance optimization.

I like improving sites by ensuring they load quickly regardless of device and network conditions, from the initial developing process to auditing and analysis.

Currently I am working as a Technical Owner at [Spotify](https://spotify.com) in Stockholm, Sweden. Occasionally [I speak at web conferences and meetups](/talks/) and [work on side projects](/projects/). I'm also a Google Developer Expert in Web Technologies.
