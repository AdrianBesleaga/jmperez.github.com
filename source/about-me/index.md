# Hello ðŸ‘‹ !

I am a Software Engineer who likes web development and performance optimization.

I like working with companies to improve their sites, ensuring they load quickly regardless of device and network conditions. From the initial developing process to auditing and analysis.

Currently I am working as a Technical Owner at [Spotify](https://spotify.com) in Stockholm, Sweden. Occasionally [I speak at web conferences and meetups](/talks/) and [work on side projects](/projects/). I'm also a [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/experts/about) in Web Technologies.
