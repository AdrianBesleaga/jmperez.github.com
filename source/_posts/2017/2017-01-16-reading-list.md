I have decided to collect some of the best posts and articles I have read during last days. It is inspired by [Bruce Lawson](https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brucelawson.co.uk%2F)’s reading lists and web development newsletters. I write it to keep track of interesting content for myself, but you might also find it useful.

## Posts

*   [**Modernizing our Progressive Enhancement Delivery**](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.filamentgroup.com%2Flab%2Fmodernizing-delivery.html)**.** Another excellent post by Filament Group. This time they talk about integrating HTTP/2 and ServiceWorker on their site, providing good performance and offline capabilities.
*   [**Google AMP Cache, AMP Lite, and the need for speed**](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.googleblog.com%2F2017%2F01%2Fgoogle-amp-cache-amp-lite-and-need-for.html). A post on how Google processes images in AMP articles to improve performance based on compression, responsive images and WebP. By the way, if you are into AMP, don’t miss [the first AMP Conf](https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2FAMP%20Conf), which will be live-streamed.
*   [**Saving you bandwidth through machine learning**](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.google%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle-plus%2Fsaving-you-bandwidth-through-machine-learning%2F). Another post by Google, this time on upscaling small images while keeping crisp details and reducing the blurriness of traditional methods. The [algorithm is called RAISR](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fresearch.googleblog.com%2F2016%2F11%2Fenhance-raisr-sharp-images-with-machine.html) and can be run on mobile devices in real time.
*   [**Start with a line, let the planet complete the picture**](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.googleblog.com%2F2016%2F12%2Flandlines.html). A fun project in which you draw lines and get images from Google Maps to create an infinite line of rivers, roads or coastlines. It made me discover the [Vantage-point tree](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FVantage-point_tree) structure.
*   [**Preparing for a Front-End Web Development Interview in 2017**](https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdavidshariff.com%2Fblog%2Fpreparing-for-a-front-end-web-development-interview-in-2017%2F). A post by David Shariff, from Amazon, on the topics you should when interviewing for a front-end dev position.
*   [**How I converted my React app to VanillaJS (and whether or not it was a terrible idea)**](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhackernoon.com%2Fhow-i-converted-my-react-app-to-vanillajs-and-whether-or-not-it-was-a-terrible-idea-4b14b1b2faff). A long and insightful post on writing a website mimicking React’s approach using VanillaJS. If you like it, the same author wrote another good post called [10 things I learned making the fastest site in the world](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhackernoon.com%2F10-things-i-learned-making-the-fastest-site-in-the-world-18a0e1cdf4a7) a few days ago.

## Presentations

*   [**Advanced Webpack**](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpresentations.survivejs.com%2Fadvanced-webpack). A deck by [Juho Vepsäläinen](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fbebraw) expalining Webpack 2 configuration, code-splitting, plugins, loaders, optimising bundles and more.
*   [**Preact & Inferno**](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fspeakerdeck.com%2Fbtholt%2Fpreact-and-inferno)**.** A short deck by [Brian Holt](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fholtbt) from Netflix comparing react, preact and inferno. I can’t find a recording, but I think it is a good overview of three libraries that are solving the same problem.

## Books

*   [**Introducing Resilient Web Design**](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fadactio.com%2Fjournal%2F11608). A book I’ve been reading these days about the history of web and how we ended up where we are. It is free and [available in many formats](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fadactio.com%2Fjournal%2F11670): web, PDF, MOBI, EPUB…
