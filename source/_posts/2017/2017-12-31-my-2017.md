This year has been a ride. More blogging and speaking than ever, and the feeling that it was well worth it.

## Blogging
During 2017 I wrote 18 blog posts. This is a high increase respect 2016.


My post [Using SVG as placeholders — More Image Loading Techniques](/svg-placeholders) was an unprecedented success.

It made it to [the top of Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15696596), renowned sites about frontend ([CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/svg-as-a-placeholder/), [Webdesigner Depot](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2017/11/popular-design-news-of-the-week-november-13-2017-november-19-2017/), [Adactio](https://adactio.com/links/13108)), and newsletters ([CSS Weekly](http://css-weekly.com/issue-290/), [Smashing Magazine](http://mailchi.mp/smashingmagazine/smashing-194-big-bang-relaunch-ux-and-fighting-scammers-1131597), [React Native Coach](http://reactnativecoach.com/issues/16)).

To be honest, my work was "just" collecting ideas and examples from very talented developers. I hope this gives their impressive work even more attention.

Not only was the SVG published in the sites I love reading. Some of my posts about progressive image loading got referenced from [Addy Osmani's excellent images.guide](https://images.guide/#-a-id-lazy-load-non-critical-images-href-lazy-load-non-critical-images-lazy-load-non-critical-images-a-), [Perfplanet's calendar](http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2017/progressive-image-loading-using-intersection-observer-and-sqip/), and [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/blog/an_introduction_to_progressive_image_rendering).

This is definitely a push for me to continue documenting techniques to improve website performance.

On a broader note, I continued making improvements to this blog. I moved many images to [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com), which scales and reencodes the images to tailor them to the user's device. This resulted in shorter load times, [especially in 3G](https://twitter.com/jmperezperez/status/929039257808916480). I should strive for good performance on a site that talks about that very same topic.

## Open source projects
I built a couple of open-source projects related with Spotify. The first one is a library to interact with Spotify's Connect API called [spotify-player](https://github.com/JMPerez/spotify-player) which I described on [Playing with the Spotify Connect API](/spotify-connect-api). The second one is [C - Collaborative listening](https://github.com/JMPerez/c), a collaborative room where users can propose, vote and listen to music.

## Conferences and interviews
This year I spoke at [RenderConf 2017 in Oxford](/render-conf-oxford-2017), [JSDayES in Madrid](/jsdayes-madrid-2017), [Alicante Frontend](/speaking-alicante-frontend), and [Frontfest in Moscow](/frontfest-moscow-2017). I also attended [React Alicante](/react-alicante-2017)'s first edition, in my home town.

I spoke with [Isabel Romero](https://twitter.com/c_isabelromero), who works at [ULab](https://ulab.es), the coworking space in Alicante that hosts the meetup [Alicante Frontend](https://www.meetup.com/Alicante-Frontend/). You can [watch the interview on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLczq5ay8H0).

Something new this year was [a podcast I recorded about PWAs](/wecodesign-pwa) with Ignacio and Carmen from [Wecodesign](http://wecodesignpodcast.com), a Spanish podcast about web development and design.
